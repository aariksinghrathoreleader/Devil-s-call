# SpectraCall: Summon Holograms, Command with Gestures

*"Summon the unseen. Command the Spectra. Control the Call."*  
A futuristic holographic display that follows your hand gestures like pure magic.

## Project Overview

Imagine this: You upload an image â†’ It erupts into a ghostly 3D Hologram â†’ You control it with the mere movement of your hand gestures.

**SpectraCall** is not merely a project â€” it is the dark embodiment of summoning a visual illusion that obeys your hand. Your hand is the master key, your hologram â€” the servant of your will.

This project transforms any image into a stunning 3D Hologram using:

- **Hand Gesture Recognition** to Zoom In, Zoom Out, or Close the hologram.
- **Raspberry Pi + Camera Module** for image capture and processing.
- **Holographic Fan Display** to create the 3D holographic effect.

Itâ€™s not just a display. Itâ€™s a dark force summoned by your command.

## Features

- **Converts 2D Image to 3D Hologram in real-time.**
- **Hand Gesture Control:**
  - **Zoom In** â†’ Move your hand closer to the camera.
  - **Zoom Out** â†’ Move your hand away from the camera.
  - **Close Hologram** â†’ Move your hand to the left.
  - **Rotate Left** â†’ Swipe your hand left.
  - **Rotate Right** â†’ Swipe your hand right.
  - **Tilt Up** â†’ Move your hand upward.
  - **Tilt Down** â†’ Move your hand downward.
- **Built with Python + OpenCV + Flask + Three.js.**
- **Real-time Gesture Recognition** using OpenCV.
- **Image Upload** via Web Interface.
- **Entirely Wireless Setup.**
- **Multi-Object Support** â†’ Switch between different holograms with hand gestures.
- **Customizable Hologram Effects** â†’ Apply different visual effects to the holograms.
- **Interactive User Interface** â†’ Simple web interface for image upload and control.
- **Feedback Mechanism** â†’ Visual or audio feedback when gestures are recognized.

## How to Run This Project

1. **Upload Image & Control Hologram:**
   - Move hand closer â†’ **Zoom In.**
   - Move hand away â†’ **Zoom Out.**
   - Move hand left â†’ **Close Hologram.**
   - Swipe hand left â†’ **Rotate Left.**
   - Swipe hand right â†’ **Rotate Right.**
   - Move hand up â†’ **Tilt Up.**
   - Move hand down â†’ **Tilt Down.**

## Future Improvements

- **Voice Control** â†’ Integrate Google Assistant/Alexa to control the hologram.
- **Mobile Control** â†’ Upload and control the hologram via a mobile app.
- **Video Holograms** â†’ Stream videos in hologram mode.
