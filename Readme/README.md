# SpectraCall: Summon Holograms, Command with Gestures
"Summon the unseen. Command the Spectra. Control the Call."A futuristic holographic display that follows your hand gestures like pure magic.


 Project Overview
Imagine this: You upload an image â†’ It erupts into a ghostly 3D Hologram â†’ You control it with the mere movement of your hand gestures.

SpectraCall is not merely a project â€” it is the dark embodiment of summoning a visual illusion that obeys your hand. Your hand is the master key, your hologram â€” the servant of your will.

This project transforms any image into a stunning 3D Hologram using:
1. Hand Gesture Recognition to Zoom In, Zoom Out, or Close the hologram.
2. Raspberry Pi + Camera Module for image capture and processing.
3. Holographic Fan Display to create the 3D holographic effect.

Itâ€™s not just a display. Itâ€™s a dark force summoned by your command



 Features
1.  Converts 2D Image to 3D Hologram in real-time.
2. Hand Gesture Control:
   a. Zoom In â†’ Move hand closer.
   b. Zoom Out â†’ Move hand away.
   c. Close Hologram â†’ Move hand to the left.
3.  Built with Python + OpenCV + Flask + Three.js.
4.  Real-time Gesture Recognition using OpenCV.
5.  Image Upload via Web Interface.
6. Entirely Wireless Setup.



 How to Run This Project
   
   Upload Image & Control Hologram:
     1. Move hand closer â†’ Zoom In.
     2. Move hand away â†’ Zoom Out.
     3.Move hand left â†’ Close Hologram.




 Future Improvements
   1.  Voice Control â†’ Integrate Google Assistant/Alexa to control the hologram.
   2.  Mobile Control â†’ Upload and control the hologram via a mobile app.
   3.  Video Holograms â†’ Stream videos in hologram mode.
   4.  AI-Based Gesture Control â†’ Use TensorFlow for better accuracy.
