3D Holographic Display Using Hand Gestures
"Turning your imagination into reality with a 3D Holographic Display controlled by hand gestures."

Project Overview
Imagine this: You upload an image → It instantly converts into a 3D Hologram → You control it with your hand gestures.
This project transforms any image into a stunning 3D Hologram using:
1. Hand Gesture Recognition to Zoom In, Zoom Out, or Close the hologram.
2. Raspberry Pi + Camera Module for image capture and processing.
3. Holographic Fan Display to create the 3D holographic effect.

Features
1.  Converts 2D Image to 3D Hologram in real-time.
2. Hand Gesture Control:
   a. Zoom In → Move hand closer.
   b. Zoom Out → Move hand away.
   c. Close Hologram → Move hand to the left.
3.  Built with Python + OpenCV + Flask + Three.js.
4.  Real-time Gesture Recognition using OpenCV.
5.  Image Upload via Web Interface.
6. Entirely Wireless Setup.

How to Run This Project
   Upload Image & Control Hologram:
     1. Move hand closer → Zoom In.
     2. Move hand away → Zoom Out.
     3.Move hand left → Close Hologram.

Future Improvements
   1.  Voice Control → Integrate Google Assistant/Alexa to control the hologram.
   2.  Mobile Control → Upload and control the hologram via a mobile app.
   3.  Video Holograms → Stream videos in hologram mode.
   4.  AI-Based Gesture Control → Use TensorFlow for better accuracy.
 The possibilities are endless.
